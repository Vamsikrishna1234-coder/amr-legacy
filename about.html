        <h2>Our Story</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>AMR Legacy</strong> is a new-age real estate company fueled by passion, precision, and purpose. Built by a team of seasoned 
            professionals, AMR began with a single belief — that creating a home is not just about constructing walls, 
            but about crafting experiences that last generations. From day one, our goal has been to redefine modern 
            living by combining aesthetic excellence with strong structural integrity. Every project we design is 
            thoughtfully planned, rooted in innovation, and executed with unwavering attention to detail.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
            <strong>AMR Legacy</strong> is a real estate company driven by a passion for quality, integrity, and customer
            satisfaction. Starting from modest beginnings, AMR quickly established itself by delivering
            residential and commercial spaces marked by superior craftsmanship and timely delivery. Every
            project reflects our belief that excellence should never be compromised, and every detail
            thoughtfully considered. Our vision goes beyond building — we create environments that inspire
            and endure. Integrity guides every promise and partnership, while timely delivery is
            a principle we live by. From the first conversation to the final handover, <b>AMR</b> ensures a seamless, personal, and
            rewarding experience for every customer.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
            As a growing brand, <b>AMR</b> is driven by a vision to create communities where comfort, luxury, and nature come 
            together seamlessly. We believe in continuous learning, continuous improvement, and continuous delivery of 
            the highest standards in real estate. Our mission is not just to build homes — but to build trust, build 
            relationships, and build a legacy that will inspire future generations. With AMR, every square foot is 
            designed with purpose, every detail shaped by passion, and every project built with the promise of a 
            brighter tomorrow.
